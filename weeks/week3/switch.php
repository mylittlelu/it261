The name itself is derived from Latin and is a combined version of three combined Latin words. This includes Dous, Plus, and Pleo which create the word Duplus. When this was translated into Italian, the rough word that came from this became Doppio. Pronounced DOH-pee-oh, the word just means double in Italian.</p> ';
